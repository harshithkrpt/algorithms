# What is Dynamic Programming

- Logic that reduces repeted computation

- Like :

- Combinations
- Greedy Easy Apporach Possible

## Iteration vs Recursion

- iter -> speed , easier complexity , shorter code , harder techniques
- recur -> easy to apply , fewer states , order does not matter wrt states

- erictto prefers iterative dynamic programming
