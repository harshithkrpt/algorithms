# Introduction

## Recap

- Binary search is a lot faster than simple search.
- O(logn) is faster than O(n) but it gets a lot faster once the list of items you're searching through grows.
- Algorithm Speed is not measured in seconds
- Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm.
- Algortithm times are measured in BigO notation.
