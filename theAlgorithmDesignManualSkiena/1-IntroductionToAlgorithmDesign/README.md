# Take Away

- There is a fundamental difference between algorithms,
  which always produce a correct result, and heuristics, which may usually do a good job but without providing any guarantee.

- Reasonable-looking algorithms can easily be incorrect. Al-
  gorithm correctness is a property that must be carefully demonstrated.

- The heart of any algorithm is an idea. If your idea is
  not clearly revealed when you express an algorithm, then you are using too low-level a notation to describe it.

- Searching for counterexamples is the best way to disprove
  the correctness of a heuristic.

- Modeling your application in terms of well-defined struc-
  tures and algorithms is the most important single step towards a solution.
