# Key Take Away

- Think intutively for a better solution for functions like heap_compare in the heap_sort which takes O(k) time complexity

## Randomization

- Randomization is a powerful tool to improve algorithms with bad worst-case but good average-case complexity.

- Randomized quicksort runs in Î˜(n log n) time on any input, with high
  probability if you permute the given input before running the function

- Randomized hash, randomized sampling , randomized search are few examples

## 4.7 Distribution Sort : Sorting Via Bucketing

- Bucketing is very efficient whenever the distribution is roughly uniform

## 4.10 Divide and Conquer

- MergeSort , Fast Fourier Transforms and Strassen's Matrix

- T (n) = aT (n/b) + f (n) recurrence relation equation
