# Data Structures

## 3.1 Contiguous vs Linked Data Structures

- Contiguously allowed structures include array, matrices , heaps and hash tables

- Linked Data structures are lists , trees and graphs adjacent lists

### 3.1.1 Arrays

#### Pros

- Constant Element Access
- Space Efficiency
- Memory Locality

#### Cons

- Dynamic Arrays are Not Dynamic have to be copied

## Take Away

- Data structure design must balance all the different operations it supports. The fastest data structure to support both operations A and B may well not be the fastest structure to support either operation A or B.

- Building algorithms around data structures such as dictio-
  naries and priority queues leads to both clean structure and good performance.

## Balanced Search Trees

- red-black trees and splay trees
- And our goal is to make the access on O(logN)

## Priority Queue

- Priority Queues have insert , findMin/Max and deleteMin/Max operations

## Hashing and Strings

- Constant Amount with good hash function with maintained load factor
- structures open addressing and chaining
- open addressing with sequential probing -> inserting to next empty slot
