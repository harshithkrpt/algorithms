# Analysis of Algorithm

## Mathematical Models for Running Time

- tilde notation ignore lower order terms

## Memory

- Megabyte - 2 ^ 20
- Gigabyte - 2 ^ 30
- old machines -> 32 bit 4 byte pointers
- modern machines -> 64 bit 8 byte pointers. (can address more memory and pointers use more space)
